Data Set Information:

This is a rule-based model that qualitatively simulates moral reasoning. The model was intended to simulate how an ordinary person, down to about age five, reasons about harm-doing.

The horn-clause theory and the 202 instances are the same as were used in (Wogulis, 1994). The top-level predicate to predict is guilty/1. For more information, e.g. on the generation of instances, see (Wogulis, 1994).
