Data Set Information:

In the experimentation, 30 single page documents were considered. They are copies of letters sent by Olivetti. Six trials were performed by randomly selecting 20 documents for the training set and 10 for the test set. Each document is identified by a letter (A to Z) or a pair of letters (AA, AB, AC, AD).
