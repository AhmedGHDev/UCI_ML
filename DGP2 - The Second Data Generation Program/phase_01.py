Data Set Information:

DGP/2 is an improvement of DGP. It allows for additional parameters and automates the setting of the standard deviation parameter, which is not easily done by the user. In particular, DGP/2 allows for variation in the number of instances, the number of features, the range of feature values, the number of peaks, the percent of positive instances desired and a radius around the peaks that these instances will fall within (this controls instance density, and determines the standard deviation value for the normal distribution function).
