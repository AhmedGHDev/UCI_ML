Data Set Information:

I collected 64 e-mails from DBWorld newsletter and I used them to train different algorithms in order to classify between 'announces of conferences' and 'everything else'. I used a binary bag-of-words representation with a stopword removal pre-processing task before.


Attribute Information:

Each attribute corresponds to a precise word or stem in the entire data set vocabulary (I used bag-of-words representation).
